Schedule a theme to display on the live site for holidays or special events. (Available from Appearance - Scheduled Themes)

== Description ==

This plugin allows a wordpress administrator to schedule a different theme to display on the website for holidays or special events for all visitors.

The theme will be overridden on the live site for all people who visit the site. Great for setting a Christmas theme!

If you just want to have a css file added instead of a whole theme, check out the wp-scheduled-styles plugin.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload folder `wp-scheduled-themes` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Set the themes that you want to have scheduled
1. Test and enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My Theme is scheduled to appear, why does it not show up? =

This can happen if you have 2 themes scheduled to appear at the same time. The theme that was scheduled to appear the earliest in the year will always appear.

= I want to schedule changes, but I don't want to duplicate my entire theme for a minor change =

Maybe wp-scheduled-styles is the plugin for you! This plugin will let you specify an additional .css file to be included from your theme.
